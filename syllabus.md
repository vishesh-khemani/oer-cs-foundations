Students will practice object-oriented programming and apply elementary data structures and algorithms to medium-scale applications. They will also have exposure to the theory of computing and computing machines.

## Course Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to:
- Collaborate with team members in problem solving while employing effective version control principles
- Apply divide and conquer approaches typically employed by professional software engineering teams to solve problems in a team setting
- Develop an expertise and level of comfort with the command line (i.e., using a terminal)
- Use industry standard approaches to manage the solution to a computer problem into a single unified final result (i.e. software packages, executables, and deployables)
- Explain low level memory management techniques using appropriate tools (such as the C and C++ programming languages)
- Evaluate and justify algorithmic and code choices through the lens of optimizing memory management
- List and describe the major topics and results in the theory of computing
- Develop appropriate prompts for a generative AI, such as ChatGPT, to develop a program and evaluate generated output for effectiveness
